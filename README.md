# KMP-Project
 
 KMP algorithm is a strategy to speed up the pattern matching problem.

 This algorithm creates an index on the pattern and use it to scan the text in a more efficient way. 

 The program is then tested through a Unit Testing approach.

 Project for the course of Scientific Programming of MSc. Bioinformatics for Computational Genomics.
